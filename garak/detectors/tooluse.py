"""Tool-use security detectors

Detectors for :mod:`garak.probes.tooluse`. These inspect a model's text output
for signs that it misused a (text-simulated) tool.

garak has no structured tool-call channel yet (see NVIDIA/garak#1969), so tools
are simulated at the text level by the probe and detection works on the emitted
text.
