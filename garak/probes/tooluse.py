"""Tool-use security probes

Probes that test whether a tool-using model can be manipulated into misusing its
tools. This module currently implements credential exfiltration through tool-call
parameters, the first slice of NVIDIA/garak#1872.

garak has no structured tool-call channel yet (see NVIDIA/garak#1969), so the tool
is simulated at the text level: the model is told how to emit a tool call as text,
and the paired detector inspects that text for the planted secret.
